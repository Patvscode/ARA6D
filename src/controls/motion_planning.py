"""
motion_planning.py

Placeholder module for future motion-planning features.

This file is intentionally minimal right now, but the intended responsibilities
include:
    - kinematic solvers (forward/inverse)
    - trajectory generation (velocity/acceleration profiles)
    - collision/limit checking

As the project grows, this module will become the home for planning utilities
that translate high-level targets into joint-space command sequences.
